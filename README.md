                The **Smart Blind Stick** is a groundbreaking assistive device I've developed to enhance the mobility and independence of visually impaired individuals. Here's what it features:

- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: The stick uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in the user's path and provides real-time feedback.

- **Vibration Alerts**: It communicates obstacle proximity through haptic feedback, allowing users to navigate safely without relying solely on auditory cues.

- **Navigation Assistance**: With its intelligent navigation capabilities, it can guide users to predefined destinations, such as bus stops or shops.

- **Open Source**: This project is open-source, and I believe in the power of collaboration. Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or adapt it to different use cases.
